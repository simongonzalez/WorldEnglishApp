# Welcome to the World English Accent App.

A comprehensive web application for visualising vocalic differences in World Englishes


[App Link](https://simon-gonzalez.shinyapps.io/worldenglishaccents/)

This app is an interface to listen to accented English. The audio data is obtained from the Speech Accent Archive [1], which was processed and forced-aligned at the word level using the Montreal Forced Aligner [2]. A map with speakers'place of origin is also included.

Users can listen to the available data by selecting: Language, Country, Region, City and Gender

Since the app was mdeployed with a Free account, there are specific limitations that can affect the app performance:

Up to 25 active hours per month. If it exceeds 25 active hours, users will receive a polite notice that the application is not available and to try again later.
The default active continuous time in the app is 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the app may restart.
If there are many users accessing the app at the same time, there may be an overload and the app will not function properly.

NOTE: Since the data was prepared using automatic processes, not all the data from the archive is present. Only the processed subset is in the app. Also, there are irregularities which we can fix along the way. For example, when selecting individual words, the segmenation maybe incorrect, like cutting the beginning/end of the word or when another word has been selected.

Please notify us of any issues (simondariogonzalez@gmail.com - Subject: Word English App).

Thank you and enjoy listening to English around the world.
